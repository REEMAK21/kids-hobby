Kids are usually confused about which field or hobby they are passionate about or enjoy doing such as (academic/art's/sports), so we attempted to choose a dataset that is collected from parents as a survey that gathers information about their child's preferences to prepare a classification model that predicts the kids' hobbies.

By analyzing this dataset, we hope to offer insightful information that will aid parents in guiding their kids toward the right hobbies.
